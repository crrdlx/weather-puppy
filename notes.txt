next steps...
. figure a way to bookmark a link to a city (so you don't have to search every time)
. redraw the images with bolder lines. maybe, make gifs (test that gifs work first)
. if it's worth it, figure a way to code a randomization effect. for instance, for a sunny day, I would have like 3 sunny-day images or gifs and one would be randomly chosen.
